# email-template-tables
This is a new email template that I am developing and testing for internal purposes but that I am keeping as generic as possible so others can take advantage of some of the formatting options. I am using tables to structure the template. This template is thoroughly tested in outlook and solves many of the formatting problems that generally occur when rendered in the Microsoft client. It will appear almost identical to the way gmail renders their emails
